===============================================================================

This program models metal oxides consisting of two different metal ions. The
program has only been tested for Mg and O, but the DFT method, using CASTEP,
can test other metals that take the same crystal structure as NaCl as an oxide.

============================== DEPENDENCIES ===================================
Gfortran
https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran
Ensure Gfortran, the GNU Fortran compiler, is installed on the system. This is
used to compile the Fortran 90 programs, which is done automatically by the
shell scripts.

Grace
http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/
Grace is required to obtain plots of the relative energies of the modelled
systems (after ratios have been altered).

Jmol (provided)
http://jmol.sourceforge.net/
Jmol can be found in src/jmol-14.29.13 and can be run by typing ./jmol.sh in
the command line. Jmol will be run automatically after testing for the lowest
energy configuration of a 16-atom unit cell with method 1.
Any generated *.cell file or *.xyz file can be opened through Jmol, once
it is running, or can be opened with the following command, when in the RSM
directory:
./src/jmol-14.29.13.sh path_to_cell_file

CASTEP (provided for this assignment)
http://www.castep.org/
For the purposes of this assignment, the executable for CASTEP has been
provided.
The CASTEP code is available under a free of charge license to all UK academic
research groups under the terms of an agreement between STFC, University of York
(for UKCP) and Dassault Systèmes BIOVIA.

Environment modules
When on running Ubuntu on the University of York computers, environment modules
will be fully set up. This allows for CASTEP to run successfully.

Open MPI
https://www.open-mpi.org/
Open MPI is required to be able to run CASTEP.

============================== INSTALLATION ===================================

To be able to run RSM, please ensure the scripts are executable. Simply run
the following command when in the RSM directory:
chmod +x rocksalt.sh atomistic.sh writeparam.sh

After this, run the following command (to be able to use the DFT method):
module load intel openmpi

=============================== RUNNING RSM ====================================

1) Open up a terminal and change to the RSM directory containing
rocksaltmixing.sh
2) To interact with the command line interface, run the following command:
./rocksaltmixing.sh
3) Follow the instructions in the terminal

To run the program indirectly with a control file, simply put your options
into the 'control.in' file in the order as listed below. The control.in file
provided contains an example for input choice.
Line 1: Model choice, 1=DFT, 2=atomistic
Line 2: Task, 1=ratio test, 2=atom arrangement test
Line 3: First metal atom to be tested in oxide structure, e.g. Mg, Ca, Ni
Line 4: Second metal atom to be tested in oxide structure
Line 5: Unit cell size: 8 or 16 only supported options for the time being

Method 1, task 1 output:
The output for the DFT model will be found in the MgO.castep files in each of
the tested oxide unit cells.
The plot of relative energy for metal ratios can be found at MgCaRatio.png in
the main directory.

Method 1, task 2 output:
Data for the tested permutations of the metal oxide mixture can be found in the
permutations directory. When task 2 is completed, Jmol will boot up to display
the unit cell.
To view the repeating structure, simply go to File>Console and type in:
module "" { 2 2 2 }

Method 2 output:
The results of the atomistic model can be found in Jmol_xyz which are to be
viewed in Jmol manually. The data generated by the model can be found in the
data_files directory.

========================= ENABLE SPIN POLARIZATION =============================

To test Ni, simply go to line 6 of writeparam.sh and change 'false' to 'true'
